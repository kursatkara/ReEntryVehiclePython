ReEntry Vehicle Tutorial - Python Version
=========================================
Copyright 2021 Cadence Design Systems, Inc. All rights reserved worldwide.

This is a Python implementation of the Re-Entry Vehicle Glyph scripting
tutorial, found in the standard Tutorial Workbook that is installed with
Pointwise. It generates an extruded structured block around a contrived
periodic re-entry vehicle shape.

A few minor deviations from the original Tcl script have been
made to illustrate some of the more 'pythonic' aspects of the `Glyph Client
for Python`_.

.. _`Glyph Client for Python`: https://github.com/pointwise/GlyphClientPython

This script requires `Glyph Client for Python`_ and Pointwise_ V18.2 or
higher.
